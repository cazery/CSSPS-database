Along with China's continuous development in recent years, in terms of the environment: environmental indicators in local areas and industries have improved, but the current situation of environmental deterioration has not yet been fundamentally curbed. The environmental situation in China shows new characteristics: rising environmental risks, frequent environmental accidents, increased mass incidents and aggravated environmental damages. We found that the number of mass incidents caused by industry and agriculture in large and medium-sized cities is increasing, and the number of watershed and regional pollution incidents caused during production is increasing. Therefore, our based on the level of Anhui Province, we analyzed the problems of surface pollution sources for the water system of Chaohu Lake, and constructed a survey database of problems related to pollution sources into Chaohu Lake by means of statistics and markers, and carried out corresponding activities with this.

The database was collected by the Anhui Beidou Precision Agricultural Information Engineering Laboratory and contains research data on pollution sources in Chaohu Lake, Anhui Province. It is used for the scientific research and teaching tasks of Anhui Beidou Precision Agricultural Information Engineering Laboratory, as well as for the team's disciplinary research on the local surface source pollution problem of Chaohu Lake in Anhui Province, and the pollution load problem of Chaohu Lake into the lake.
